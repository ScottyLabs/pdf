# Setup

## Visual Studio Code

The first thing you should do is install Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is
an integrated development environment (IDE) that will allow you to write and
run your code easily. VS Code in particular has many extensions you can install
that make writing in HTML and CSS very fast.

Download the app (According to whether you are using a Mac or Windows):
[https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Live Server Extension

To install the Live Server Extension in VSCode, click on the search icon in VS
Code in the left side bar and install the extension.
To use it, click the bottom right button that says ”Go Live” to see the site
you built! Whenever you save, you should see your changes in real time.

### File Setup

1. Create a folder on your computer called ”PDF”
2. In VS Code, navigate to Explorer (the top icon on the left), click ”Open
   Folder,” and choose ”PDF”
3. Open ”New File...”, enter file name ”portfolio.html”, and begin!

## Git
